# rustlings ü¶Ä‚ù§Ô∏è

### This repo contains solution to rustlings exercises by Anup Jadhav.

**NOTE** Don't use this repo to "run" rustlings on your machine as I've deleted the `rustlings` executable files from this repo. Please see the [original Rustlings repo](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) to run rustlings.

Greetings and welcome to `rustlings`. This project contains small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code. This includes reading and responding to compiler messages!

_...looking for the old, web-based version of Rustlings? Try [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/tree/rustlings-1)_

Alternatively, for a first-time Rust learner, there are several other resources:

- [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html) - The most comprehensive resource for learning Rust, but a bit theoretical sometimes. You will be using this along with Rustlings!
- [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html) - Learn Rust by solving little exercises! It's almost like `rustlings`, but online
